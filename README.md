# Slidey Pix

Welcome to Slidey Pix: A sliding puzzle game!

This project was built in collaboration with [Alyssa Lerner First](https://github.com/alerner1) and is a virtual sliding puzzle game. We both loved playing the physical version of this game growing up, so we thought it would be fun to create a virtual version of our own!
